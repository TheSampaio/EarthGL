# EarthGL

A small 3D scene with the planet Earth in space programmed from scratch with C++ and modern OpenGL. I made this project to practice my graphics programming skills and also because I was inspired by a similar project from one of my computer graphics professors.

## Build

**1.** You'll need CMake to build this project.  
**2.** After CMake installation, clone this repository using the following command:

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/TheSampaio/EarthGL --recursive
  ```
**3.** Open the project with your preferred IDE (I recommend Visual Studio for Windows).  
**4.** Now, just build with CMake and run the executable program.

## Credits

The inspiration for my project was another one called [_Blue Marble_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDFXFgd_flA&ab_channel=ThalesSabino) made by my professor [_Thales Sabino_](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFZCPq--PwSkfVkkRsRUUqQ) for his YouTube channel. I would also like to thank him for helping me enter the world of computer graphics and teaching me all the necessary fundamentals.

## Acknowledgments

I would also like to thank and recommend:
