<h1>EarthGL</h1>
<section>
    This project is being developed for that I can practice everything I learned from my studies about OpenGL. My goal is to reproduce the planet earth's view in space. I'll use <a href="https://www.glfw.org/download.html">GLFW</a>, <a href="https://glad.dav1d.de/">GLAD</a>, <a href="https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/">GLM</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nothings/stb">STB</a> and C/C++ to be able to use OpenGL and finish the project.
